Baseline commit parameters gave:a small kink in termo trajectories with ar drop over 21
trajectories. Regular acc rate is 60%; and that was at lambda 5000

tried lambda=500.0 got more oscillations but not a single proper kink, and still super
autocorrelated

tried eps*=10 acc rate osc betw 9 and 15%

with 2 lang it has ar==0 with any number of md

with T_md=59 ar is alomosts always 0 or below 1% Stays at constant the throws itself to
another vacuum

tried same with old small eps, ar is now 70% system got copuple kinks and decent termospeed
(params were T_md=59 esp=2.5e-6

tried same with T_md=99 ar did  not drop significantly (it is now around 62%) (run is 217secs)
decent evolution speed now good kinks

(I wonder who brakes though domain boreders - langevin or md and how important is eps for
that)

For now i am trying to use low eps and longer md step, so far it does not give very good
domain braking

Tried T_md=169 ar still around 69, but sometimes goes way lower, but seemingly only for
lower index trajectories it has created a sole kink in that termo range and evolves at
ok speed, but still no good kinks

treid eps *=3, it ar is almost always 0

tried eps*=3 T_md=4 eps=2.5e-6*3 ar around 40 pretty slow evolution

tried eps*=10 T_md=4 eps=2.5e-6*10 ar around 13% and still slow evolution 

REVERTED to baseline here
Seems that kinks are actully supressed with this set of params, try higher beta

switched to beta=3 instead of 1.43 

For each beta there is curtain different epsilon

Switched to lambda 300 for beta=4

Tried L+md+L+md no ar drop, but no significant difference
